        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1 - ">What Is New In HC Standard<sup>®</sup>4.4?</h1>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> 4.4 features several new and improved features. Some highlights in HC 4.4 include the following.</p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 1: ">Persistent User Settings</h2>
        <p>When users make changes to the layout of matrices, maps and dashboards, those items will no longer revert to their defaults at the end of a session. All of the choices a user made will remain when the user next logs into the system. A user can choose to return all of the settings to their defaults using the <b>Reset</b> <b>Settings</b> button on the <b>Edit Profile</b> panel, or to return the display settings on a particular matrix to their defaults using the <b>Reset</b> button on the matrix <b>Display</b> dropdown.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 2: ">Matrix Sections</h2>
        <p>Measures associated with an entity group can now be placed into any number of different sections. Matrices based on the entity group will automatically display the measures in their assigned section in the <b>entity</b> <b>measures</b> <b>view</b>. Users can also choose to view all measures at once. Unassigned measures are displayed under the heading <b>Overview</b>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 3: ">Manipulate Measures in Matrices</h2>
        <p>Users can now not only choose to display all available measures by selecting <b>Display All</b> with a single click or tap, they can choose to <b>Display None</b> with a single click or tap, too.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/site icons/whatsnew2.png" class="newwindows" />
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, users can now re-order measures in a matrix by <i>clicking</i> or <i>tapping</i> a measure and <i>dragging</i> it to the desired location in a matrix. </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 4: ">Add GPS&#160;Coordinates from Web</h2>
        <p>Users can add now add GPS coordinates to a record using the web application. For more information, <MadCap:xref href="../Using HC Standard Web Client/Matrices/Using a Matrix.htm">see "Using a Matrix" on page 1.</MadCap:xref></p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 5: ">Submatrices</h2>
        <p>Users with the appropriate permissions can now create either a private or public submatrix directly from an existing matrix, rather than having to build each new matrix from scratch. Users can view data as it will actually appear in the new submatrix by <i>setting </i><b>sort</b>, <b>filter</b> and <b>display</b> <b>preferences</b> in the existing matrix. When the settings are correct, <i>clicking</i> <b>Create SubMatrix</b> will launch the <b>Add SubMatrix</b> tool with those settings pre-populated on the appropriate tabs.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 6: ">Save and Next While Editting Entity Data</h2>
        <p>Instead of being required to save data changes made to an entity and then move to the next entity, users can now save and move to the next entity in the matrix with a single click of the <b>Save and Next</b> button</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/site icons/whatsnewsaveand.png" class="newwindows" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 7: ">Access Rules - Notifications</h2>
        <p>Users and administrators with the appropriate permissions can now send a single input-required notification using a matrix to which individual users have only partial access. If access rules are applied, each recipient of the notification will be able to enter data only for the entities they have permission to see and edit..</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="h2nobreak" MadCap:autonum="1 - 8: ">Pin Clusters in Maps</h2>
        <p>When there are too many pins in a certain area of a map for all of them to be displayed at the current magnification, HC Standard<sup>®</sup> will display hexagonal pin clusters that tell the user how many pins are in that area: Small green icons for 2 to 10 pins, medium-sized yellow ones for 11 to 100 and large red ones for more than 100.</p>
