        <p>The EWRAP™ was designed with simple use standards in mind. To set up and turn the device on, please follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the EWRAP™ case by unfastening the Security Latches on the side of the case and opening the case door.</li>
            <li>Turn the Power Switch from the off position, 0, to the on position, 1. The Power Switch will turn green when the power is on.</li>
            <li>Remove the Telescoping Antenna Mast with the attached Antenna Cord from the case.</li>
            <li>Place the Antenna Cord in the Antenna Cord Slot and close the case door.</li>
            <li>Stand the EWRAP™ case in the upright position.</li>
            <li>Attach the Telescoping Antenna Mast to the Antenna Mount on the side of the case by lining up the grooves of the mast to the bolts on the mount. Secure in place by pressing down on the mast. Hold the bottom of the mount and mast while extending the mast to prevent it from coming off of the mount.</li>
            <li>Extend the Antenna Mast. Pull out on the mast latches and extend upward while feeding the Antenna Cord through the bottom of the mast.</li>
            <li>Allow up to 5 minutes for the EWRAP™ to power up and to establish a connection. The unit will be ready to use after it emits a single chirp followed by two chirps.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 MadCap:conditions="Default.combined" MadCap:autonum=" ">Storage and Charging </h3>
        <p>Store the EWRAP™ inside under typical room conditions and near an outlet for easy charging.

Maintain a charge on the EWRAP™ so that when an emergency arises, the device can be deployed with a full battery. </p>
        <p>Charging the EWRAP™ battery:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the unit to allow air to circulate around the battery while it charges.</li>
            <li>Unravel the power cord from inside the case.</li>
            <li>Plug the unit into any standard AC electrical outlet.</li>
            <li>View the Battery Charge Indicator to see the charge level.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Battery Tender charging modes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Red Light</li>
            <li>Green Light</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When to charge the battery:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>During periods of non-use, the battery can maintain a charge for up to 1 month without having to be connected to a power source.</li>
            <li>The unit should be plugged in and fully charged at least once per month.</li>
            <li>If the battery charge indicator is red or yellow, plug the unit in to charge.</li>
            <li>Review Appendix B for additional battery information.</li>
        </ul>
