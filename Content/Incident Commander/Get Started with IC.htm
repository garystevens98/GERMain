        <p style="font-weight: bold;">About HC Standard<sup>®</sup> Incident Commander</p>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> Incident Commander was developed with decisive action in mind. It provides the Incident Commander with a high level summary of incident information in near real-time, with the ability to delve deeper into the detailed data when necessary.</p>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> Incident Commander incorporates the data captured by HC Patient Tracking™ and displays the information on an easy-to-view, customizable dashboard. The dashboard and all other information displays on any mobile device, including tablets.</p>
        <p>Role-based access allows emergency team members (users) to view only the information that is relevant to them. While some users may need only high level information, others require access to detailed patient data. This role-based access ensures HIPAA/HITECH compliance.</p>
        <p>There are two permission types that may be granted for this system:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 13px;">
            <li><b>Non-Personal Health Information (Non-PHI</b>) – Only high level information regarding patient counts and transport destinations are viewable.</li>
            <li><b>Personal Health Information (PHI)</b> – All details for patients and facilities are viewable. </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: #000000;">Access is determined by an HC Standard<sup>®</sup> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.combined">Service</MadCap:conditionalText> Admin, and may only be changed by an Admin.</p>
