        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> allows people working in multiple locations, and/or fulfilling diverse healthcare responsibilities, to effectively track patients and manage key resources. The system is completely customizable, allowing each organization to decide exactly what to track and who has access to information.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Examples of resources tracked in HC Standard<sup>®</sup> include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 13px;">
            <li>Facilities:   hospitals, plant status, specialty beds, etc.</li>
            <li>Alternate  Care Sites: skilled nursing facilities, long term acute care beds, etc.</li>
            <li>Equipment:   ventilators, monitors, durable medical equipment, etc.</li>
            <li>Supplies:   blood, medicines, fluids, linens, etc.</li>
            <li>People:  staff members, volunteers, patients, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Examples of reasons for tracking such resources include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 13px;">
            <li>Patient Triage and Treatment:   daily EMS runs, hospital surge, mass casualty events.</li>
            <li>Earthquake:   relief supplies, transportation location, funds allocation.</li>
            <li>Hurricane Evacuation:   shelter locations and allocation, family reunification, fatalities, mortuary affairs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information in the system, or available within the system via direct, live data feeds, can be presented as tables, charts, reports or maps, and/or exported in several common file formats. Users can submit and update data from virtually anywhere, using a wide variety of devices, including desktop PCs in hospitals, laptops in temporary facilities, tablets on the go, or handheld computers at an incident scene.</p>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> and the HC Standard<sup>®</sup> Suite of applications are HIPAA and HITECH compliant. &#160;Data is encrypted on the local device, whenever information is synchronized, and finally at the back-end server. </p>
        <p>Information is only available to authorized users with the appropriate permissions.</p>
