        <p class="TopicSubsections">Track, Measure, and Export Critical and Routine Information</p>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> is a flexible system for structuring information and allows an organization to aggregate all data, both critical and routine, from a variety of sources.  No matter what the data (e.g. patients, ambulances, blood types, vehicles, alerts, weather conditions or even parking spaces), it can be tracked in HC Standard<sup>®</sup>.  Data can be collected, measured, shared, viewed, and exported to allow quick communication and decision-making throughout the organization.</p>
        <p class="TopicSubsections">Workspaces</p>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> <b>Workspaces</b> keep mission critical information, along with communication and decision-making tools at the user's fingertips.  This provides actionable intelligence for near real-time situational awareness that supports decision-making, regardless of the incident. <MadCap:xref href="#Workspaces" class="figures">FIGURE 1-1</MadCap:xref> is an example of information maintained in a user's workspace.</p>

        <p class="TopicSubsections">Notifications</p>
        <p>Notifications can be sent as an email, a text message, or directly within HC Standard<sup>®</sup> as a pop-up. <MadCap:xref href="#Notification_Bar" class="figures">FIGURE 1-2</MadCap:xref> is an example of a notification sent to a user.</p>

        <p class="TopicSubsections">Customizable Charts, Reports and Maps</p>
        <p>Customizable charts, reports and maps in HC Standard<sup>®</sup> allow for data to be arranged in compelling visual forms.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Charts</b> and <b>Maps</b> are <i>dynamic</i>, reflecting data changes as soon as they occur. Custom icon images on maps can be associated with the data and displayed automatically.</p>
        <p><b>Reports</b> can be refreshed to include the latest data entries and can be exported in Acrobat (.pdf), comma delimited (.csv), Excel (.xls), Rich Text Format (.rtf), and Tagged Image File Format (.tiff) formats.  Built-in report functions, including averages and totals, facilitate at-a-glance decision-making.</p>
