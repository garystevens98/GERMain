            <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> was designed to be flexible and customizable in order to efficiently meet the needs of individual organizations.  Therefore, it is important to fully understand and document the organization's current business processes before starting to configure the system. </p>
            <p>To build out a system that fits into each unique business process, it is important to visually map out the process. This aids in understanding the needs of key users within an organization. Spending this time on the front end will aid in a more efficiently designed system. </p>
            <p>Generally, users only need access to critical job-specific information.  Therefore, organizations are strongly encouraged to start the design of each system slowly and with a clear and simple approach. This eliminates unnecessary confusion for various users.  </p>
            <p>One of the most important components of building out an HC Standard<sup>®</sup> system is giving users access to data. This manual explains how to create and modify the elements discussed, and how to make them available within HC Standard<sup>®</sup>.</p>
            <h2 class="h2nobreak" data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Users:&#160;Key Groups and their Respective Roles</h2>
            <p>Begin by listing all of the potential users and categorizing them into different groups. Groups should be created based on related job duties and responsibilities.  Each group will be given access to certain data in HC Standard<sup>®</sup>, along with the permission to view and/or edit that data.  Keep in mind that individual users can be placed in more than one group, and entire groups can be placed within other groups.</p>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Identify Key User Groups</h3>
            <p>Make a list of all the key groups within the organization. Ensure that all of the key users have an opportunity to identify the groups involved in their areas of operation. For example, user groups might include "Responders", "Leadership" and "All Employees".</p>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Identify Administrators (Admins)</h3>
            <p>Admins are users with advanced privileges in HC Standard<sup>®</sup>. Admins have the ability to create and manage users and permissions, workspaces and workspace items, entities, and notifications. </p>
            <p>Any Admin user given permission to make changes to matrices or entity groups must be in the <b>System Notifications</b> user group.  Users in this group will receive notifications, emails, or text messages when changes to matrices or entity groups are completed.</p>

                        <td class="Important">&#160;</td>
                        <td class="callout">
                            <p><b>Important!</b> The System Notifications user group should never be deleted.</p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Identify Sub-Administrators (Sub-Admins)</h3>
            <p>Depending on the size of an organization and scale of the system, Admin responsibilities may need to be divided up among certain users.  When a user is delegated to perform some, but not all, Admin functions in the system, the user is considered a sub-administrator, or <b>Sub-Admin</b>.</p>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Identify Key Operational Duties of Group Members</h3>
            <p>After identifying the key user groups within the organization, the next step is identifying elements that each group needs to access.</p>
            <p>For example, All Employees may need to have access to summary reports and charts, but may not be given permission to update the status of a specific item on the 5th floor of a building. Therefore, a top down approach is recommended. To do this, first identify the general areas of responsibility for each group and the related tasks the users will need to perform. It is easier to go back later and refine permissions for  certain members of a group who require a higher level of access.</p>
            <h2 class="h2nobreak" data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Data:  Entities and their Characteristics</h2>
            <p>It is necessary to identify the entities that need to be tracked and the information  about these entities that needs to be collected. <a href="#Fully_realized_matrix_example" class="figures MCXref xref xreffigures">FIGURE 3-1</a> is an example where the entities being tracked are patients and the data being collected about each patient includes age, allegies, and triage information. </p>
            <p class="noafter"><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="../Resources/Images/admin/matrix.png"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img imgnewwindows" data-mc-width="2159" data-mc-height="473" src="../Resources/Images/admin/matrix_thumb_0_0.png" tabindex="" /></a>
            </p>
            <p class="Figuretest" data-mc-autonum=" FIGURE 3-1: "><span class="autonumber"><span> FIGURE 3-1: </span></span><a name="Fully_realized_matrix_example"></a>Fully realized matrix example</p>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Identify Entity Groups</h3>
            <p>Entities are the things that can be tracked. Entities of the same type are put into entity groups (e.g. "Patients", "Buildings", "Vehicles", or "Equipment"). </p>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Identify Measures</h3>
            <p>Organizations must determine what of information needs to be collected about each entity. Each category of information is known as a measure. Measures show the status of the  entities and contain a single piece of information that needs to be tracked. For example, status and features, such as Vehicle Condition and Wheel Base- are measures that describe Vehicle entities.</p>
            <p>Once it is clear what needs to be tracked and what specific data should be collected, it is much easier to begin to build out an HC Standard system to meet unique needs and business processes.</p>
            <h3 data-mc-autonum=" "><span class="autonumber"><span> </span></span>Using Administrator Tools</h3>
            <p>Certain items contained in HC Standard<sup>®</sup>, including charts and reports are built out from other items, so there is a logical sequence to creating them when starting from scratch.  The <b>Users</b> category is a good place to start.</p>
