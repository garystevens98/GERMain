        <p>Access to HC&#160;Standard<sup>®</sup> Incident Commander depends on permissions being granted to a single user or a group of users.</p>
        <p>Based on the permissions given, a user will have access to only <i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">non-Patient Health Information</i> (Levels 1 and 2) <i>or</i> access to full<b> Patient Health Information</b> (Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4).</p>
        <p>A user group has been created in HC&#160;Standard<sup>®</sup> called <b>ICS&#160;Users</b>. A user in the <b>ICS Users</b> group has access to the Incident Commander application and only the first two levels: <b>Incident Summary</b> and <b>Triage</b> <b>Status</b> <b>Summary</b>. A user in this group also has access to the ICS Workspace which in turn gives access to the <b>Patient Information ICS No PHI</b> and the <b>Transport Destination Locations</b> matrices. No other access is needed to view non-PHI.</p>
        <p>Access to PHI requires additional permissions to grant access to the master <b>Patient Information</b> matrix. This must be done through another user group to allow access to all four levels of  HC&#160;Standard<sup>®</sup> Incident Commander.</p>
