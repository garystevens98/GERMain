        <p>Each facility should have generic facility-specific logins. Multiple people CAN log in with a single account simultaneously. However, if the wrong <b>Username</b>/<b>Password</b> is entered incorrectly three times in a row, that <b>Username</b> will become locked out. That’s why it is good to have a backup <b>Username</b>/<b>Password</b>. <b>GER</b> can unlock the account, if you are not able to get a hold of <b>Support Desk</b>, contact your <b>HCF</b> for assistance.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Enter your facility-specific <b>Username</b>,  <b>Password</b> and <i>click</i> <b>Sign In</b></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>NOTE: If you are only training – go the training/exercise boards instead!!</p>
        <p>If your agency is not listed (or you cannot locate it), please notify GER and they can get you added into the system. (DO NOT log in as a different facility if you cannot find your own on the dropdown menu.)</p>
