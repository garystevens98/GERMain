        <p>The <b>Users and Permissions</b> category contains the <b>Users</b> tool for management of individual user accounts, and the <b>Groups</b> tool, which allows users to be associated and assigned permissions en masse.</p>
        <p>Access to HC Standard<sup>®</sup> is granted only to those who have a user account with a valid username and password.  Access to HC Standard<sup>®</sup> workspaces containing all data in the system is granted only to user groups that have been assigned to those Workspaces and given a set of <b>permissions</b>.  To allow someone to view and work with data in HC Standard<sup>®</sup>, you will use the <b>Users</b>, <b>Groups</b> and <b>Permission</b> tools. For example, a user that is not in any groups will see nothing in HC&#160;Standard<sup>®</sup>.</p>
