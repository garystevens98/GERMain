        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> PERK&#160;Tracking was developed to assist agencies in recording chain-of-custody movements for Personal Evidence Recovery Kits. Information collected in HC&#160;PERK&#160;Tracking™ is dispersed to appropriate users and agencies in a secure manner. </p>
        <p>HC Standard<sup>®</sup> PERK Tracking also includes a Victim Portal where victims can track their kit as it enters and leaves an agency. If victims do not choose to file a report, they see a countdown page with the amount of time remaining to file a report.</p>
        <p>Role-based access allows agencies (users) to view only the information that is relevant to them. While some users may need only high level information, others require access to see detailed PERK data. This role-based access ensures HIPAA/HITECH compliance.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000;">Access is determined by an HC Standard<sup>®</sup> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.combined">Service</MadCap:conditionalText> Admin, and may only be changed by an Admin.</p>
